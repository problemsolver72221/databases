# What we did today 

First part: We discussed what is a database and why we use them in the context of the todo example from Node.js class. We discussed the types of databases out there, with focus on: relational databases and document stores. We introduced some basic concepts in databases, such as normalization, primary and foreign keys, schemas, etc. Also, we looked into the most commonly used databases and the ones with most features: http://db-engines.com/en/ranking.

Second part: We installed MySQL on all laptops. We went through the basic steps of dealing with MySQL database: creation of database, creation of table schema, describing a table, and the four CRUD commands: `select`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete`. We practiced these commands in CLI and we made sure that the node.js example file todosServer.js could run on every laptop.

Our goal is to make the Node.js version of the todo application use a database to make managing the data 
in the todo list easier and more structured. 

Your homework will be to change the todo project that you worked on in the last class to use MySQL instead of a text file to store the Todos.
This assignment is about reading and writing data from MySQL using Node.js.

## Overview of important concepts from today's lecture
Relational Database, Document Store, Schema, Normalization, Table, Document, N-to-N (many-to-many) relation, Primary key, Foreign key

Make sure that you understand what each of these means.

# MySQL client and server 
We saw that MySQL has two parts - a client and a server 
Now we understand how to start the command line interface to MySQL and connect to the running server to issue commands.

# CRUD in MySQL

There are similarities between the HTTP actions (verbs) and what we've been doing in MySQL:

`POST` is similar to `INSERT`

`PUT` is similar to `UPDATE`

`DELETE` is similar to `DELETE`

`GET` is similar to `SELECT`

# Commands

## Create database and table(s)

We created a new database named `todos` with the following command
`create database todos`

We told MySQL to use this database now using
`use todos`

We listed all databases with `show databases` and all tables in the current database with `show tables`.

Creating new tables (spaces in the database to store data) using the command
```
create table todos (
	Id int, 
	Done boolean, 
	Name varchar(255)
);
```

The primary key constraint can be added to prevent duplication, like this:
```
create table todos (
        Id int,
        Done boolean,
        Name varcha5(255),
	primary key(Id)
);
```
Show the schema of a table (not what is IN the table) using:

`desc todosTable`

`describe todosTable`

`show columns from todosTable`
(these all do the same thing!)

## INSERT

*Insert* a row into a table:
```
insert into todosTable (Id, Name, Done) values (1, 'First todo', false); # OK
```

or if you do not specify the fields (Id, Name, Done), they are used in the default order:

```
insert into todosTable values (1, false, 'First todo'); # OK
```

If you have set the id field as a primary key, then you should let MySQL decide on the value of this value. You can do this by setting the `Id` to null:
```
insert into todosTable values (null, false, 'First todo'); # OK
```

## UPDATE

*Update* a specific row or set of rows in a table. Be careful to specify which row(s) to update, because otherwise all rows will be updated! You can do this using the `WHERE` clause. Example for an UPDATE operation:

```
UPDATE todosTable
SET Done=false
WHERE Id=2
```

## DELETE

*Delete* table (both schema and all rows) using the `drop table todosTable` syntax (be careful!)

Delete only table rows (keep schema):
```
delete from todosTable;
```

Delete only some rows, based on a WHERE clause:
```
delete FROM todosTable WHERE id=3;
```

NOTE: Don't forget to end each command in the CLI with a semicolon.

NOTE #2: Remember that `FROM` and `WHERE` go with every CRUD command in MySQL. `FROM` is obligatory to specify a table for an operation, while `WHERE` is optional (if you don't use `WHERE`, then your operation affects all table rows!)

NOTE #3: In the 1-to-1 session, we discussed the difference between varchar(1) and varchar(255) (or any number)
If you are not clear on this please read the first 5 paragraphs of this:
[MySQL char and varchar](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/char.html)

# Homework 1

Previously you managed to build a todos app with a flat file. Now we are going to save todos in a database instead of a file.
Your homework is to implement the following [http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html](HTTP VERBS). As we discussed:

You need create three pieces to do this:
1) Create the needed database and define a table schema for the `todosTable` table that will store the list of todos.
The table should look as follows (verify this before going to node.js):
```
mysql> desc todosTable;
+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Id    | int(11)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| Done  | tinyint(1)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| Name  | varchar(255)| YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

Advice: Use CLI for this, as this is typically executed once and is good to have control

Advice #2: Use some of the constraints I showed you today, such as Primary key. This is not required for this assignment, but it will really make your life easier.

```
mysql> desc todos;
+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Id    | int(11)     | NO   | PRI | NULL    | 	 	      |
| Done  | tinyint(1)  | YES  |     | 0       |                |
| Name  | varchar(255)| YES  |     | NULL    |                |
+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

2) In the node.js server, Create functions to `insert`, `update`, `select` and `delete` todos. We have created an example client and a start for the server at https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases/tree/master/TodosServerMySQL. If you prefer, you can also create your own Express server instead of building upon our server file.

3) Make those functions available to API users through the express framework you used with Daan and Erol. We have already pre-created these four API endpoints, you just have to link them to the functions you created in 2).

As we discussed - we provide you with the implementation of `GET` (`SELECT` in MySQL)` as an example and you guys can do the rest.
