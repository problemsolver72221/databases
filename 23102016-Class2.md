# What we did today 

We went further with relational databases, concretely with MySQL. This was the outline of class 2:

0. Q&A (past assignment)

1. SQL injection (https://xkcd.com/327/)

1. Testing your API with Postman and Curl

2. Model-View-Controller (MVC)

3. Errors and warnings (in your routes, as well as the DB)

4. Commits and rollbacks

5. Types of variables, default values, Null values and length

6. Contraints: Auto_increment, Unique.

7. Keys: Primary and Foreign Keys

8. Other operators in SQL: ORDER BY, LIKE, IN, AS.

9. JOIN operators

10. SQL Functions: arithmetic operations and NOW()

# Commands

### Alter default value

ALTER TABLE Persons ALTER COLUMN City SET DEFAULT 'Sandnes';

### Set default value and null/not nulls on table creation

CREATE TABLE Persons
(
P_Id int NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Address varchar(255),
City varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Sandnes'
);

### Drop DEFAULT constraint

ALTER TABLE Persons ALTER City DROP DEFAULT;

### Change auto_increment step

ALTER TABLE Persons AUTO_INCREMENT=100;

### UNIQUE constraint

CREATE TABLE Persons
(
P_Id int NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Address varchar(255),
City varchar(255),
UNIQUE (P_Id)
);

ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD UNIQUE (P_Id);

### PRIMARY KEY

CREATE TABLE Persons
(
P_Id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Address varchar(255),
City varchar(255)
)

### FOREIGN KEY

CREATE TABLE Orders
(
O_Id int NOT NULL,
OrderNo int NOT NULL,
P_Id int,
PRIMARY KEY (O_Id),
FOREIGN KEY (P_Id) REFERENCES Persons(P_Id)
)

### LIKE: match based on regular expression

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country LIKE '%land%';

### IN: multiple allowed values

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City IN ('Paris','London');

### ORDER BY

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country DESC;

### JOIN

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;

### Arithmetic functions

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID) AS OrdersFromCustomerID7 FROM Orders
WHERE CustomerID=7;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS NumberOfCustomers FROM Orders;

SELECT SUM(Quantity) AS TotalItemsOrdered FROM OrderDetails;

SELECT AVG(Quantity) AS AverageItemsOrdered FROM OrderDetails;

### NOW()

INSERT INTO Users (first, last, whenadded) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', NOW());


# Homework 2
This week we'll continue with the code from the last assignment. We'll be adding the `User` resource, and the functionality to share/link todos with users. To do this, you'd need to:

1. Create a `User` table
2. Make sure that both tables `User` and `tableTodos` guarantee consistency. For this, you have to ensure that the primary and foreign keys are well set-up, and that the needed constraints are set (e.g. auto_increment).
3. Add a `/user` endpoint in your API to create and read user information from your DB
4. Support updating the `/user` information so you can link that user to a todo item
5. Support getting the users that use a particular todo
6. Support getting the todos of one user

*Bonus:* Add a `/user/count/letter` endpoint that will allow GET requests only. This endpoint gives back the amount of users whose name starts with the `letter` given as a parameter.
