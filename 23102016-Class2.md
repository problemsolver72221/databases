# What we did today 

We went further with relational databases, concretely with MySQL. This was the outline of class 2:

0. Q&A (past assignment)

1. Testing your API with Postman and Curl

2. Model-View-Controller (MVC)

3. Errors and warnings

4. Commits and rollbacks

5. Types of variables, default values, Null values and length

6. Contraints: auto_increment, unique, ... 

7. Keys: Primary and Foreign Keys

8. Further CRUD stuff (delete all/some items, drop table, update based on text substring, â€¦)

9. JOIN operators

10. Other operators in SQL: ORDER BY, LIKE, IN, arithmetic operators.

## Overview of important concepts from today's lecture

# Helpful links 

# Commands

# Homework 2

1. Update the database and the node.js code from week 1 in order to be resilient to mistakes, by using the features from today: primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, variable specification, conditional CRUD.

2. Exercises to test the understanding of the JOIN logic

3. Something to test the operators we learnt today, e.g. arithmetic  and string matching operators.
