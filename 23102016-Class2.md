# What we did today 

We went further with relational databases, concretely with MySQL. This was the outline of class 2:

0. Q&A

1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)

2. Errors and warnings

3. Types of variables, default values, Null values and length

4. Contraints: auto_increment, unique, ... 

5. Keys: Primary and Foreign Keys

6. Further CRUD stuff (delete all/some items, drop table, update based on text substring, â€¦)

7. Commits and rollbacks

8. JOIN operators

9. Other operators in SQL: ORDER BY,
