# What we did today 

We went further with relational databases, concretely with MySQL. This was the outline of class 2:

0. Q&A (past assignment)

1. Testing your API with Postman and Curl

2. Model-View-Controller (MVC)

3. Errors and warnings

4. Commits and rollbacks

5. Types of variables, default values, Null values and length

6. Contraints: auto_increment, unique, ... 

7. Keys: Primary and Foreign Keys

8. Further CRUD stuff (delete all/some items, drop table, update based on text substring, â€¦)

9. JOIN operators

10. Other operators in SQL: ORDER BY, LIKE, IN, arithmetic operators.

1. Create a `User` table
2. Add a `/user` endpoint in your API to create and read user information from your DB
3. Support updating the `/user` information so you can link that user to a todo item
