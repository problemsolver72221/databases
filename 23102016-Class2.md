# What we did today 

We went further with relational databases, concretely with MySQL. This was the outline of class 2:

0. Q&A (past assignment)

1. SQL injection (https://xkcd.com/327/)

1. Testing your API with Postman and Curl

2. Model-View-Controller (MVC)

3. Errors and warnings (in your routes, as well as the DB)

4. Commits and rollbacks

5. Types of variables, default values, Null values and length

6. Contraints: auto_increment, unique, ... 

7. Keys: Primary and Foreign Keys

8. Further CRUD stuff (delete all/some items, drop table, update based on text substring, â€¦)

9. JOIN operators

10. Other operators in SQL: ORDER BY, LIKE, IN, arithmetic operators.

ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET DEFAULT 'literal';



# Homework 2
This week we'll continue with the code from the last assignment. We'll be adding the `User` resource, and the functionality to share/link todos with users. To do this, you'd need to:

1. Create a `User` table
2. Make sure that both tables `User` and `tableTodos` guarantee consistency. For this, you have to ensure that the primary and foreign keys are well set-up, and that the needed constraints are set (e.g. auto_increment).
3. Add a `/user` endpoint in your API to create and read user information from your DB
4. Support updating the `/user` information so you can link that user to a todo item
5. Support getting the users that use a particular todo
6. Support getting the todos of one user

*Bonus:* Add a `/user/count/letter` endpoint that will allow GET requests only. This endpoint gives back the amount of users whose name starts with the `letter` given as a parameter.
