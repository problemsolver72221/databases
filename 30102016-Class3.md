# Class 3 review


# What we did today

We discussed the previous MYSQL assignment, the differences between databases, and introduced everybody to MongoDB. This was the outline of class 3.

0. Q&A (past assignment)

1. Overview on types of databases: [image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rOeRQ.png)

1. Installing MongoDB.
	* The MongoDB runs in the background in its own service, just as the MYSQL daemon.
	* To install:
		* Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install mongodb-server`
		* Mac:
			* If you've got homebrew installed: `brew update && brew install mongodb`
			* Otherwise, follow the steps here [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/#install-mongodb-community-edition-manually)
		* Windows: Go to [https://www.mongodb.com/download-center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center). If you've got window8 or higher, select `Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit and later, with SSL support x64` and download + install.

4. Creating a todo collection in mongodb

## Overview of important concepts from today's lecture

# Helpful links

* https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/api-articles/nodekoarticle1.html : A good introduction to the NodeJS MongoDB client

# Commands

* Selecting a collection: `use todos`

* Inserting data: `db.todos.insert({todoLabel: "eat breakfast", done: false})` (in MYSQL this would be: `insert into todos (todoLabel, done) values ('eat breakfast', false);`)

* Finding todos that are not done yet: `db.todos.find({done:false})`

* To update existing documents, for example set todos with label 'east breakfast' to done:
	```
	db.todos.update(
		{'todoLabel': 'eat breakfast'},
		{
			$set: { 'done': true}
		}
	)
	```
	In MYSQL this would be: `update todos set done = 1 where todoLabel = 'eat breakfast';`

	Docs for Mongo here - https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/update/

	Remember that the first part is what to search for to change and the `$set` part is what to change.

	So in this case we are looking for a todo with a `name` = `Do some stuff` and changing the `done` value to 1.

	Also remember that Mongo only changes the first record unless we add `{multi: true}` as a third argument to the update command.

	* To delete data:
	Docs for Mongo here - https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/remove/

	`db.todos.delete({'todoLabel': 'eat breakfast'})`

	while in MySQL we would say:

	`delete from todos where todoLabel = 'eat breakfast'`

### Using with Node.js
Simply run `npm install --save mongodb`. This will install the Mongo driver for you. You can more-or-less the same commands as we showed in the Mongo command-line. Check [this link](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/api-articles/nodekoarticle1.html) for some examples.


# Homework 3
We built the todos server last week using a relational database (MySQL). For this week we will keep the same structure (YOU DID THE HARD PART ALREADY) and change the database to use Mongo instead.
**This one should be easy!**

You might see the term `CRUD` used in some documentation. This stands for:

**C**reate - create some data

**R**ead - query some data

**U**pdate - update some data

**D**elete - delete some data

CRUD is simply a short way of talking about the operations you can perform on data.

A few tips:
 - Use Postman
 - Use the mongo command line (mongo.exe) to create the `todos` database
 - Remember that Mongo uses `documents` and `collections` instead of `records` and `tables` but you can think about them a little bit the same way.
 - When you insert into Mongo it will assign a unique ID to the document for you and return that ID
 - Think about the difference between inserting data (MySQL) and inserting an entire document to a collection.
