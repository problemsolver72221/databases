# Lesson 3: Data Models, Relationships, and Schemas

In the final week, additional theory will be covered to discuss more complex relational data. Students will learn about entity relationship modelling and how to convert these models to a database schema using normalisation and foreign-key constraints. Non-relational data will also be considered, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of relational and non-relational models.

Objective: Students should be able to create an entity relationship diagram based on a qualatative description of data requirements, and translate that into a MySQL database schema. Students should also be able to compare and contrast relational (like MySQL) and NoSQL databases (considering their benefits and drawbacks).

## Main Topics

- More complex entity relationship diagrams
- Foreign key constraints
- Introduction to normalisation
- CREATE TABLE syntax
- DELETE, TRUNCATE TABLE, DROP TABLE
- NoSQL and non-relational data
- Basic entity-attribute-value data in MongoDB

## Reference Material

## Homework

For this week's homework, please describe the entity relationships for the data model in your application (one to one, one to many, many to many). Then design the database schema including what tables you will need, the columns in these tables, which column is the primary key, and any foreign key constraints between tables.
